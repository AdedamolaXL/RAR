# RAR - Random Algorithm Radio
> A different way of listening, curating and finding music!

RAR is a Web3 music application that turns playlist creation into a verifiable game of randomness, taste, and reputation using [Pyth randomness](https://github.com/pyth-network/pyth-examples/tree/main/entropy). It‚Äôs where music listening becomes a form of play.!


## Inspiration
Traditional music platforms use predictable algorithms that often lead to echo chambers. We wanted to create a platform where:
- True randomness drives discovery
- Community curation meets algorithmic generation
- Blockchain verifiability ensures fair and transparent processes
- Turning playlist making into a game of discovery and excitement. 

## What It Does
üéÆ Playlist Battles
- Coin-flip start: Begin with a blockchain-verified coin flip that determines your starting conditions
  - Heads initialize your playlist instance with 0 songs.
  - Tails initialize your playlist instance with 2 songs. 
- Energy-based gameplay: Manage energy units to:
  -  add songs(-5 eu),
  -  pass on tracks (-3 eu),
  -  rearrange your playlist (+2 eu),
  -  or just pause and do nothing (+5 eu)
- Random song reveals: Use cryptographic seeds to reveal songs from your personal library.
  - We turn the 64 hexademical string generated for each random seed into an ideal 64 song queue
  - Where if the next character in your string determines if you get a song in your next queue or not
    - if the next character in the string is numbers, you get a song revealed
    - if the next character is an alphabet, no song is revealed :)   
- Gallery submission: Share your curated playlists with the community

üéµ Daily Algorithmic Playlists
- Blockchain-seeded randomness: Daily random seeds from Pyth Entropy ensure truly unpredictable playlists
- Smart distribution: Algorithm fairly distributes songs across multiple daily playlists
- Fresh daily content: New playlists generated every 24 hours

üèÜ Reputation & NFTs
- Playlist Reputation NFTs: Earn NFT-based reputation when your playlists get upvoted
- Decay mechanics: Reputation naturally decays over time, encouraging ongoing engagement
- Community voting: Upvote/downvote system with blockchain integration

## How We Built It
Frontend
- Next.js 14 with App Router
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Wagmi and Viem for blockchain interactions

Backend & Infrastructure
- Supabase for database and storage
- Next.js API Routes for serverless functions
- PostgreSQL for relational data

Blockchain & Smart Contracts
- Arbitrum Sepolia for low-cost transactions
- Pyth Network for verifiable randomness
- Custom Solidity Contracts:
  - [RandomSeed.sol](https://github.com/AdedamolaXL/RAR/blob/main/contract/contracts/RandomSeed.sol) - Daily random seed generation
  - [CoinFlip.sol](https://github.com/AdedamolaXL/RAR/blob/main/contract/contracts/CoinFlip.sol) - Fair random number generation for gameplay
  - [PlaylistReputationNFT.sol](https://github.com/AdedamolaXL/RAR/blob/main/contract/contracts/PlaylistReputationNFT.sol) - Reputation tracking with decay
