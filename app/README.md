# RAR - Random Algorithm Radio

This Next.js project demonstrates an experimental music platform that combines algorithmic playlist generation with blockchain randomness. The application features Web3 integration, verifiable randomness from Pyth Entropy, and gamified music discovery experiences.

## Features

- **Algorithmic Playlists**: Blockchain-seeded algorithm generates fresh playlists daily.
- **Playlist Battles**:  Start with verifiable coin flips using Pyth Entropy + Cryptographic seed-based song discovery.
- **Playlist Reputation NFTs**: Time-based reputation decay to encourage ongoing engagement

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- Bun installed for fast package management.
- Farmiliarity with Next.js, Wagmi.sh, Tailwind, Shad.cn and React Query

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
bun i
```

### Running the Development Server

To start the development server, run:

```bash
bun dev
```

This will start the server on `http://localhost:3000`, and you can view your application in the browser.

## Acknowledgments

This implementation of Pyth Entropy for music and gaming applications was inspired by innovative uses of blockchain randomness. Special thanks to the Pyth network for providing verifiable entropy services and the broader Web3 community for continuous innovation.

We hope these contracts inspire further development at the intersection of music, gaming, and blockchain technology, creating new possibilities for community-driven content creation and discovery.
